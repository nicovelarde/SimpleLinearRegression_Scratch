# SimpleLinearRegression_Scratch
Implemented the Simple Linear Regression Algorithm from Scratch without using Scikit-learn

## Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python
- math (Python Library)
- statistics (Python Library)

## Class Implementation:

### SimpleLinearRegression Class:
- The SimpleLinearRegression class implements the Simple Linear Regression algorithm. It calculates the best-fit line for a given dataset and provides methods to predict and evaluate the model.
### Example data:
- Sample training and test datasets are provided for demonstration purposes.
## Key Features and Functionalities:
- Data Retrieval: Load and preprocess the dataset for training and testing.
- Model Training: Fit the Simple Linear Regression model to the training data.
- Prediction: Predict the target variable for new data points.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the regression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error,(RMSE), and R2 Score.
## Skills Demonstrated:
- Implementation of the Simple Linear Regression algorithm from scratch.
- Understanding of the principles and assumptions behind linear regression.
- Ability to predict and evaluate the performance of the regression model.
## Note: 
This model can improve its accuracy by using Gradient Descent to find the coefficients that produce the least error.
Usually people use only the Mean Squared Error to evaluate this model, it is not necessary to implement the three evaluations.
